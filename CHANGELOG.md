### üîÑ Migration from v1.0

If you're upgrading from the original version:

1. **Backup your data** before upgrading
2. **Update your commands** to include Redis and pgbouncer ports:
   ```bash
   # Old way
   ./run.sh odoo18 10018 20018
   
   # New way (recommended)
   ./run.sh odoo18 10018 20018 6383 6436
   ```
3. **Check port conflicts** - the new version will detect and prevent them
4. **Review configuration** - new performance and Redis settings available
